   <p id="p2">Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>

   <h2 class="h2">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2><br>
 <ul>
   <li class="l1"><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food <br>changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,<br> the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,<br> and other applied science.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food <br>changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li><br> 

   <li class="l1"><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields. </li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation<Br> due to a rapidly expanding population</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."<br></li><br>

   <li class="l1"><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>

   </ul>
